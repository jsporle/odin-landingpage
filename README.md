I want to use more precise code in my css script and make sure to modulise all components.

the page needs the following elements in this order:

1. header
2. hero text (main, secondary, sign up button); placeholder image
3. information section (title, nestled images with captions)
4. quote section (quote, attribution)
5. call to action section
6. footer section
